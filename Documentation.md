# **Pull Request Documentation – Initial Repository Setup**

## **Overview**
This pull request sets up the **foundation** of our project repository.  
The goal is to ensure **organization, clarity, and a standard workflow** for all contributors moving forward.

## **What’s Included in This PR**

### **1. Repository Structure**
A clear and consistent folder layout was created:

```
/frontend       → All front-end code, UI components, and styling
/backend        → All back-end services, APIs, and logic
/shared         → (Optional) Common modules/assets used by both frontend & backend
```

This structure ensures that:
- Code is **logically separated** by functionality.
- Team members know exactly **where to place their work**.
- Merging and collaboration are easier to manage.

---

### **2. Configuration Files**
- **`.gitignore`**
  - Added rules to prevent unnecessary files from being committed (e.g., `node_modules`, `.env`, build files, system files).
- **`README.md`**
  - Provides an overview of the repository.
  - Explains where frontend, backend, and shared files should go.
  - Includes contribution guidelines for new developers.

---

### **3. Branching Strategy**
- **Main branches:**  
  - `main` → Production-ready code only.  
  - `Application` → Development branch where active work happens.
- Contributors should:
  - Fork the repository.
  - Create feature branches from `Application`.
  - Open pull requests targeting `Application`.

---

### **4. Pull Request Guidelines**
- **Work-in-progress PRs** should be marked with `[WIP]` in the title.
- Each PR must have:
  - At least **2 junior reviewers**.
  - At least **1 senior reviewer**.
- All comments/suggestions should be addressed before merging.
