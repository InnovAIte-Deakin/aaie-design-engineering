# Testing Proposal Document

---

## 1. Introduction

This proposal outlines the testing strategy for our full-stack web application built with React (TypeScript, Vite, React Router, Tailwind, shadcn/ui) on the frontend and Node.js (Express, Mongoose, MongoDB) on the backend, with Supabase serving as the authentication layer.

The goal is to establish a robust, scalable, and maintainable testing framework that ensures functional correctness, security, performance, and user experience consistency across all layers of the application.

---

## 2. Objectives

- Guarantee that core business logic and critical user flows operate reliably.  
- Identify and prevent regressions during future feature additions.  
- Validate data integrity and schema rules in MongoDB via Mongoose.  
- Verify that the auth layer enforces proper access control through the `x-user-id` header.  
- Maintain accessibility (a11y) standards and strong user experience.  
- Provide confidence through automation in CI/CD pipelines.

## 3. Scope of Testing

The testing strategy will cover the following layers:

### 3.1 Backend (Node.js + Express + Mongoose + MongoDB)
- **Unit Tests:** Utility functions, data validation, and middleware.  
- **Integration Tests:** Route handlers with supertest against an in-memory MongoDB; authentication middleware validation; ownership and access control logic.  
- **Model Tests:** Mongoose schema rules (required fields, uniqueness, defaults, hooks).  
- **Error Handling:** Invalid inputs, DB errors, and missing resources.  

### 3.2 Frontend (React + TypeScript + Vite)
- **Unit Tests:** Components (loading/empty/error states), hooks (`useAuth`, data fetching).  
- **Integration Tests:** Client–API interaction with MSW; LocalStorage persistence of userId and header injection.  
- **Routing Tests:** Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users; error boundary pages.  

### 3.3 End-to-End (E2E)
- Critical user journeys tested with Playwright:  
  1. User login → dashboard  
  2. Create, edit, and delete an item  
  3. Route guards and unauthorized access checks  
  4. Error scenarios (API failure, 500 error fallback)  

### 3.4 Non-Functional
- **Accessibility Testing:** with `jest-axe` and `@axe-core/playwright`.  
- **Performance Testing:** using Lighthouse CI for key routes.  
- **Security Checks:** no secrets leaked in frontend, input validation, proper error codes (401/403/404/500).

## 4. Tools & Frameworks

- **Backend:** Vitest, supertest, mongodb-memory-server  
- **Frontend:** Vitest, React Testing Library (RTL), MSW  
- **End-to-End:** Playwright  
- **Accessibility:** jest-axe, @axe-core/playwright  
- **Performance:** Lighthouse CI  
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions  

---

## 5. Test Environment

- **Backend:** Express app running on Node.js, connected to mongodb-memory-server for tests.  
- **Frontend:** Vite preview builds tested in isolated environments.  
- **E2E:** Playwright runs against the deployed preview app with seeded test data.  
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions pipeline automates testing on pull requests.  

---

## 6. Deliverables

1. Automated Test Suites: Unit, integration, and E2E coverage.  
2. Test Reports: Coverage metrics (≥80%), accessibility, and Lighthouse reports.  
3. CI/CD Integration: Blocking merges on failing tests or accessibility/performance violations.  

---

## 7. Timeline (2 Weeks)

- **Day 1–2:** Test setup: Vitest, RTL, MSW, supertest, Playwright configs  
- **Day 3–4:** Backend tests: auth middleware, 3 key routes  
- **Day 5–6:** Frontend unit/integration tests for hooks & forms  
- **Day 7–8:** E2E flows with Playwright (login, CRUD, protected routes)  
- **Day 9:** Accessibility audits (jest-axe, axe-core)  
- **Day 10:** Lighthouse CI setup and thresholds  
- **Day 11–12:** Expand backend model tests and error handling  
- **Day 13:** Visual regression setup (optional)  
- **Day 14:** CI/CD pipeline finalization and documentation  

---

## 8. Success Criteria

- ≥80% test coverage on backend and frontend.  
- Zero accessibility violations on critical pages.  
- Lighthouse score ≥90 for performance, accessibility, and SEO.  
- Automated pipeline blocks faulty PRs and ensures consistent quality.  

---

## 9. Conclusion

This proposal establishes a structured, layered testing approach for the application. By combining unit, integration, E2E, accessibility, and performance testing, we ensure the system is robust, secure, user-friendly, and production-ready.

The testing plan also integrates directly into CI/CD workflows, enabling long-term maintainability and reducing regression risks as the project evolves.
