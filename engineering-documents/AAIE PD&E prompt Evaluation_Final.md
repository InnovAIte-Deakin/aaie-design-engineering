# Prompt Evaluation: Full Rubric & Similarity Evaluation (T2 2025) and Future Scope

**Prepared by:** Product Design & Engineering Team  
**Date:** Trimester 2, 2025  
**Document Version:** Final – T2 & Future Scope  

---

## **Section 1: Current T2 2025 Deliverable**

This section outlines the implemented GenAI evaluation framework for Trimester 2, 2025.  
It includes:
- Rubric-based feedback
- AI content classification (Human / AI / Hybrid)
- Structured evaluation for academic writing  

This is currently active in the MVP and aligned with the deployed LLM model.

### **Prompt Evaluation: Full Rubric & AI Classification (T2 2025)**

The **AAIE GenAI Integrated Evaluation System** enhances academic integrity by combining AI content classification and structured writing evaluation.  

**Student requirement:** Submit both final work **and** the GenAI chat log used during content generation.

This ensures:
- Responsible GenAI usage
- Originality
- Fair feedback

### **Prompt Details (T2 2025 MVP)**

| Prompt ID | Prompt Text | Use Case |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| P001 | Write about why reducing car use in cities, like in Vauban, Germany, can be a good idea. What are the benefits, and do you think more places should do the same? | Feedback generation, AI classification |
| P002 | Discuss how social media affects teenage mental health. | Feedback generation, AI classification |
| P003 | Explain why learning a second language is valuable in today's globalized world. Provide examples from your own experiences or people you know. | Feedback generation, AI classification |

### **Evaluation Framework – Rubric Criteria**

| Level | Conceptual Understanding | Real-World Application | Critical Evaluation | Academic Writing |
|-------|--------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Excellent | Precise, in-depth understanding, with clear links to theories. | Applies to a variety of relevant real-world cases. | Thoughtful, research-backed strategies; reflects on implications. | Highly coherent, flawless grammar, proper referencing. |
| Good | Strong understanding, slightly less developed in one area. | Appropriate examples, mostly well explained. | Plausible strategies, minor depth issues. | Clear, professional; minor grammar issues. |
| Average | Adequate explanation, minor inaccuracies. | Examples present but lack depth. | Limited detail in mitigation. | Organized but with inconsistencies. |
| Needs Improvement | Limited or confused understanding. | Vague or generic examples. | Unclear or irrelevant strategies. | Poor structure, grammar, referencing. |
| Poor | Major misunderstanding. | No real-world application. | No mitigation discussion. | Disorganized, informal, unacademic. |

### **AI Classification Output**
- **Human:** Primarily written by a student.  
- **AI:** Primarily generated by AI.  
- **Hybrid:** Combination of AI and human input.

### **Prompt Evaluations**

#### **Scenario 1 – P001**
- **Student Submission:** "Reducing car use can help improve air quality and reduce accidents. Vauban, Germany, is a good example where car-free living improves quality of life."
- **AI Classification:** Hybrid  
- **Feedback Scores:** CU: Good | RWA: Average | CE: Average | AW: Good  
- **LLM Feedback:** Add examples of other cities and a concluding remark on sustainability.  
- **Teacher Feedback:** Good effort. Add global examples (e.g., Amsterdam) and strengthen conclusion.

---

#### **Prompt P002**
- **Student Submission:** "Social media connects teenagers but also causes stress, anxiety, and comparison. Using it moderately can improve mental health."
- **AI Classification:** AI  
- **Rubric Scores:** CU: Average | RWA: Good | CE: Average | AW: Satisfactory  
- **LLM Feedback:** Include both positive and negative effects with examples or statistics.  
- **Teacher Feedback:** Add examples and conclude with advice on healthy social media use.

---

#### **Prompt P003**
- **Student Submission:** "Learning a second language helps with cultural understanding, career opportunities, and communication. My friend benefited by finding a global job."
- **AI Classification:** Human  
- **Rubric Scores:** CU: Excellent | RWA: Excellent | CE: Good | AW: Excellent  
- **LLM Feedback:** Add more real-world benefits and a strong conclusion on globalization.

## **Section 2: Future Scope – AI Scoring & Similarity Model**

This section presents the **proposed upgrade** to include:
- AI content score (0–100)
- Prompt similarity thresholds (≥40% → flagged for resubmission)

---

### **Prompt Evaluation: Full Rubric & Similarity Evaluation**

**Student requirement:** Submit both final work **and** GenAI chat log.  
If similarity ≥ 40%, the submission is **flagged**.
