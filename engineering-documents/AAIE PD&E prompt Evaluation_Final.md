## Prompt Evaluation: Full Rubric & Similarity Evaluation (T2 2025) and Future Scope

Prepared by: Product Design & Engineering Team

Date: Trimester 2, 2025

Document Version: Final – T2 & Future Scope

# Section 1: Current T2 2025 Deliverable

This section outlines the implemented GenAI evaluation framework for Trimester 2, 2025. It includes rubric-based feedback, AI content classification (Human / AI / Hybrid), and structured evaluation for academic writing. This is currently active in the MVP and aligned with the capabilities of the deployed LLM model.

**Prompt Evaluation: Full Rubric & AI Classification (T2 2025)**

The AAIE GenAI Integrated Evaluation System aims to enhance academic integrity by combining AI content classification and structured writing evaluation. Students must submit both their final work and the GenAI chat log used during content generation. This evaluation process ensures responsible GenAI usage, originality, and fair feedback.

**Prompt Details (T2 2025 MVP)**

| Prompt ID | Prompt Text | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P001 | Write about why reducing car use in cities, like in Vauban, Germany, can be a good idea. What are the benefits, and do you think more places should do the same? | Feedback generation, AI classification |
| P002 | Discuss how social media affects teenage mental health. | Feedback generation, AI classification |
| P003 | Explain why learning a second language is valuable in today's globalized world. Provide examples from your own experiences or people you know. | Feedback generation, AI classification |

**Evaluation Framework**

Rubric Criteria

| Level | Conceptual Understanding | Real-World Application | Critical Evaluation | Academic Writing |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Excellent | Shows precise and in-depth understanding of cognitive biases, with clear links to relevant psychological theories. | Applies biases to a variety of insightful and relevant real-world cases, with clear articulation of cause-effect. | Provides thoughtful, research-backed strategies to mitigate biases and reflects on psychological implications. | Highly coherent and academic in tone, with flawless grammar and proper referencing. |
| Good | Understands biases well, though one may be less developed. Sound theoretical support. | Examples are appropriate and mostly well explained; some links may be weaker. | Discusses plausible strategies, though some may be underdeveloped or lacking in depth. | Mostly clear and professional; occasional grammar or structural issues. |
| Average | Adequate explanation of at least two biases; minor inaccuracies present. | Includes examples, but explanation lacks depth or connection is unclear. | Mentions bias mitigation with limited detail or superficial treatment. | Organization is present but with inconsistencies or awkward phrasing. |
| Needs Improvement | Limited explanation with surface-level or confused understanding of biases. | Examples are vague, generic, or disconnected from biases. | Strategies are unclear or unrelated to specific biases. | Structure and tone hinder clarity; referencing or grammar needs work. |
| Poor | Major misunderstanding or misrepresentation of the biases or their definitions. | No real-world application present. | No discussion of mitigation or critical reflection. | Disorganized, informal, or unacademic; serious issues with readability. |

**AI Classification Output**

- Human: Submission is primarily written by a student.
- AI: Submission is primarily generated by an AI model.
- Hybrid: Submission shows signs of both AI and human input.

# Section 2: Future Scope – AI Scoring & Similarity Model

This section presents the proposed future upgrade to the evaluation system. It introduces AI content scoring on a 0–100 scale and prompt-text similarity thresholds. Submissions with over 40% similarity to GenAI outputs will be flagged for review or resubmission. This version supports deeper LLM classification, numeric thresholds, and expanded rubric integration.

**Prompt Evaluation: Full Rubric & Similarity Evaluation**

The AAIE GenAI Integrated Evaluation System aims to **enhance academic integrity** by combining **AI content scoring, and prompt-text similarity analysis**. Students must submit both their **final work,** and the **Gen AI chat log used** during content generation. If the **similarity between prompts and final submissions is 40% or more**, the submission will be flagged for **revision and resubmission**. This evaluation process ensures **responsible GenAI usage**, originality, and fair feedback.
