## **Description**
This use case diagram focuses on the **student-side workflow** within the future scope of the AAIEâ€“OnTrack integration. It highlights three primary actors:
1. **Student**
2. **AAIE System**
3. **OnTrack**

The diagram illustrates two main **student-centered** use cases:
1. **Submitting prompts and assignments** via OnTrack.
2. **Receiving feedback** from the educator.

## **Workflow Overview**
1. The student submits the AI prompt(s) used, along with the final assignment, through OnTrack.
2. OnTrack securely transfers the submission to AAIE for processing, which includes analysis, evaluation, and preparation of results for the educator.
3. The educator reviews the AI-generated feedback, makes any necessary edits, and finalizes the feedback.
4. The student receives the finalized feedback through OnTrack.
5. The student may be given the opportunity to resubmit the work based on the feedback received.

## **Purpose**
This diagram is designed to represent only the interactions visible to the student during the submission and feedback process in the future scope of the project. Internal processes, such as AI content detection and plagiarism analysis, are intentionally omitted, as they are only accessible to educators within AAIE. The goal is to ensure clarity in the student experience while documenting the expected integration points between OnTrack and AAIE.
