**Prompt Evaluation: Full Rubric & Similarity Evaluation (T2 2025)**

The AAIE GenAI Integrated Evaluation System aims to **enhance academic
integrity** by combining **AI content scoring, and prompt-text
similarity analysis**. Students must submit both their **final work,**
and the **AI prompts used** during content generation. If the
**similarity between prompts and final submissions is 40% or more**, the
submission will be flagged for **revision and resubmission**. This
evaluation process ensures **responsible GenAI usage**, originality, and
fair feedback.
